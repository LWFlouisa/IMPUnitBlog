Welcome to my introduction, where I will discuss the latest updates my development for IMPUnit, or Improvised Personality Unit. The primary goal of the project it to make my software able to print out its results to XML format, rather than based on the public facing web. At a later point I will also be uploading versions to IPFS, and eventually IPNS once I get that figured out.

The scripts create an RSS feed for:

<pre>
-- Writing poetry
-- Create spice mix recipes
-- Writing actual RSS blog posts.
-- Image generation and recognition
</pre>

The next few blog posts will go over more specifically what I aim to achieve with each of these. But this protocol can be thought of as a Static XML generated for automated data processing. Similar to stuff like Jekyll, but for XML rather than HTML. Eventually I plan to extend it beyond jekyll and have it be useable over IPFS networks.
