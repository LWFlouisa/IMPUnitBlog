As a brief detour from AI development. Variations on Pentatonic Sakura in G with differences based on the A note. More and more I think I may work toward a complementary robotics and AI career that goes along with things Hanson Robotics does. So I might as well formalize my music scale now, for lighter dark music, if I ever switch to electronic music for robot stageplays.
